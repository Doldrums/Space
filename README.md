# SpaceTime App



This application - is a smart service that allows you to determine the magnitude of the effect of gravitational time dilation in the field of massive objects. Using the application, you will be able to visually experience the physical concept of relativity over the time of general relativity. 

### Tutorial
With this application, you can get the most accurate information about how much your own time flows faster if you climbed a high mountain or fly a plane than on the surface of the Earth.

### Step-by-step
1. Open the app
2. Click "Let's discover this"
3. Use the Seekbar to enter data to calculate time changes
4. Or open the bottom panel where you can see the visualization of the time dilation effect for the star Gargantua
5. Press the FAB button to go to info activity and read the detailed information about the physical part of the project
6. You can also scale the size of the presented timeline

### Requirements
Android API 21+
